		------------- Version: 0.0.1-SNAPSHOT ------------
First responsive version to be saved for release. This version of GreenhouseListener
is functional with JSON format making POST requests to the server. The Listener is 
able to take the data dn put it into a Mongo Database. This is a SNAPSHOT and we 
expect minimum but numorous errors to occur. This is mostly due to little testing and
code that is written in a "perfect world" way. There is not much code to support or
handle exceptions at run-time. This will change overtime and we plan to add text and
e-mail notification to various administrators of the project. In addition, it is 
importand we work towards creating a maintainable configuration file to contain 
information that is subject to change (port#, database name, notification addresses).
