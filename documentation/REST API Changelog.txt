		-------------       NEXT VERSION      ------------
 - Secure the database and application with authentication
 - Set up E-Mail notifications for data not coming in, extreme values, etc\
		
		------------- Version: 0.0.1-SNAPSHOT ------------
First responsive version to be saved for release. This version of GreenhouseListener
is functional with JSON format making POST requests to the server. The Listener is 
able to take the data dn put it into a Mongo Database. This is a SNAPSHOT and we 
expect minimum but numorous errors to occur. This is mostly due to little testing and
code that is written in a "perfect world" way. There is not much code to support or
handle exceptions at run-time. This will change overtime and we plan to add text and
e-mail notification to various administrators of the project. In addition, it is 
importand we work towards creating a maintainable configuration file to contain 
information that is subject to change (port#, database name, notification addresses).

		------------- Version: 0.0.2-SNAPSHOT ------------
The entire RESTful API was redone. Not a single file from the previous version remains.
In this new version the data is now put into the proper collections that the front end
is prepared to talk to. With this update came the use of threads to allow for larger 
amount of sensors to be handled without slowing down the system or response. This 
version is fully functional for BETA testing. It could use some cleaning up and there 
are more features we wish to add in the future. A configuration file and reader was also
implemented in this update to handle the mongoDB connection and the collection names.
This is listed below to make it easier to read quickly:
 - Added Threads
 - Added Configuration File and Reader for Mongo Connection and collection names
 - Updated the JSON format to its final form (Hopefully)
 - Disabled default MongoConnection on Spring Boot
 - Added queue for the sensor data to be put into while waiting to be handled
 - Changed end points to make more sense
 - Setup a Singleton Instance of the Mongo Client to fix memory leak

		------------- Version: 0.0.3-SNAPSHOT ------------
All previous milestones are yet to be met. In this version the configuration file 
reading was fixed. It is important to know that the configuration file is not an input
stream.

		------------- Version: 0.0.4-SNAPSHOT ------------
All previous milestones are yet to be met. 
In this version the fields given to new sensors in the sensorNames collection was 
updated for the admin UI of the front end.
