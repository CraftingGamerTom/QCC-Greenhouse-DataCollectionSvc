This service is intended to be hosted on the back-end (meaning the end-user 
will not see or access this). 

*** START-UP ***
This service begins by starting Spring and running a Tomcat server that will 
wait until a request is sent to it. [To change the port that the server runs on
please see 'main/resources/application.properties' : 'server.port'].

*** RUNNING ***
The server waits for a request and does what it is told.
